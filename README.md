I’m building a very simple digital product store with the least backend possible. 

Here’s the flow:
1. I display various digital products (thumbnail, title, category, price) on a one-pager site.
2. When the user clicks “Buy”, it takes them to Stripe Checkout to pay.
3. After payment, they’re redirected to a “Thank You” page with a download link (hosted on Google Drive).

Tech stack:
- Using Next.js (via the starter template)
- Hosting on Vercel
- Payments via Stripe
- Content is just Google Drive links
- Using Cursor AI to help me build and deploy

I have very limited coding knowledge, so I want the code to be clean, minimal, and easy to edit.

My goal:
✅ Add and update products easily
✅ Plug in Stripe keys and Google Drive links
✅ Launch ASAP

Suggest any simplifications, fixes, or improvements you think would help me.
